# Overview 

In this vignette we showcase all plots in the manuscript with their corresponding code to illustrate the usage of the `SubgrPlots` package.

# Installation {-}

The package can be installed directly from CRAN:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("SubgrPlots")
```

or the development version from github:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
## For dev version  needs devtools package
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nicoballarini/SubgrPlots")
```

# Getting started {-}

We use the `prca` dataset that is available in the package. The dataset is also available in Royston and Sauerbrei (2018)[^1].

Figure S2.3: Improved UpSet plot for subgroups defined by performance (pf), bone metastasis
(bm) and history of cardiovascular events (hx). The panel on the left (matrix)
displays how the subgroups are formed by assigning a ’+’ if the variable is equal to 1 and
a ’-’ if the variable is equal to 0. The bar plot on top of the matrix panel indicates the
marginal set sizes in relation to the total sample size, with the black region corresponding
to the 1 or ’yes’ category and the white region corresponding to the 0 or ’no’ category.
Treatment effect sizes and their confidence intervals are displayed in the panel on the
middle and the subgroup sizes in the horizontal bar plot on the right.

Figure S2.6: Contour plot of treatment effect in terms of the log-hazard ratio over the plane
of age and weight. (a) Contour lines are drawn by forming subgroups with neighbouring
subjects, calculating the treatment effect for subgroups and interpolating the results using
loess. $N_{11}$ stands for the sample size of a marginal subgroup defined by a range of age,
$N_{12}$ is the overlap size of the immediate marginal subgroups on age, $N_{21}$ is the sample size
of the subset of a marginal subgroup on age but further defined by a range of weight, and
$N_{22}$ is the overlap size of the immediate subgroups (which are the subset of a marginal
subgroup on age) on weight. (b) Contour lines are drawn by fitting a local regression at
each point of the grid, using subjects weights according to their distance to the point of
the grid. Points with few subjects in the vicinity of the grid point were left blank

Figure S2.7: Tree plot for the treatment effect in terms of the log-hazard ratio for subgroups
defined by category combinations of existence of bone metastasis (bm), history of car-
diovascular events (hx), and performance rating (pf). Each layer shows the 95% C.I.
of treatment effect differences for the associated subgroups. The purple horizontal lines
placed in the middle of the C.I. have a length proportional to the weight of subgroup sample
size over the full population. In (a) the y-axes are independent in each layer of the plot,
while in (b) y-axes are kept fixed across levels, which allows comparing variability in the
estimates.

Figure S2.23: Chord diagrams displaying the subgroups conformed by the categorised age and
weight covariates. Sample sizes are not depicted in this version as the widths are the
same for each section. Each circle displays the relative overlap of one subgroup with the
others.
